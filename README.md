# RandomForestChallenge

Random Forest challenge from Nuwe challenges in which, given a dataset, a linear regression predictive model is performed.

I use Scikit-Learn library to generate the model. More info in https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html.

I start uploading train and test datasets. I split the training data in 2 sets with the objective to train the model with the function "RandomForestClassifier()" from sklearn.ensemble and compare how good are my results plotting the correlation matrix to have the possibility of changing values if it would be necessary. After doing this, I train the model with the whole training dataset and I apply the random forest model to the test dataset given in the exercise.

Finally, I save predictions of the test model in file results.csv
